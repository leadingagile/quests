# Quest Bootstraps

Empty "start from scratch" base projects for quests, configured with testing libraries/framework

## Organization

On the top level, there are language specific directories. Here, choose the desired language for base project (this list will grow).

Within a language directory, there are directories named after the testing frameworks the setup uses. Choose the desired framwork for base project (this list will also grow).

In each directory for a particular framework, there's README.md that contains useful information, such as how to install dependencies, run tests, etc.

This library will continuously grow with new languages and testing frameworks. To contribute, please contact any current contributors, or get involved via the github at https://github.com/leadingagile/quests
